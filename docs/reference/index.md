Beambusters is an application developed to determine the detector center directly from still diffraction patterns collected in serial crystallography experiments.

Beambusters uses the methods implemented in bblib to calculate the detector center shift in each diffraction pattern, according to your initial detector geometry (CrystFEL format).

You can find more information about bblib on [this page](https://anananacr.github.io/bblib/).
